        "The study employed a mixed-methods, four-step analytic approach to investigate how expressive writing impacts adolescent anxiety, with particular focus on potential gender differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "Descriptive Analysis (Quantitative):\n",
        "First compiled and visualized basic participant information—such as age and geographical location—to establish an overall demographic profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment Analysis + t-Tests (Quantitative):\n",
        "Diary entries were subjected to sentiment analysis, measuring levels of subjectivity and objectivity. Independent-samples t-tests were then used to determine whether sentiment scores differed significantly by gender.\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic Modeling (Qualitative):\n",
        "Using a Bunka modeling tool, the research team extracted thematic “topics” from the diary texts. These were illustrated via pie charts and Venn diagrams to highlight gender-specific as well as overlapping themes (e.g., interpersonal stress versus action-oriented content).\n",
        "\n",
        "Pre/Post Anxiety Comparisons (Quantitative):\n",
        "Finally, independent- and paired-samples t-tests were conducted on participants’ Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scores before and after the writing intervention. A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot was also generated to visualize any shifts in anxiety distributions and to probe for gender-specific differences.\n",
